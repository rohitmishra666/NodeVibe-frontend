# NodeVibe Frontend with React
NodeVibe is a dynamic frontend application built using React that offers users a rich set of features including the ability to create and manage playlists, comment on content, edit comments, and perform searches with autocomplete functionality. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of the NodeVibe frontend.

To get started, clone the repository from GitHub and navigate to the project directory. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`, and then start the development server with `npm start`. This will launch the application in your default web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

The application includes several key features: secure user authentication for login and registration, the ability to add, edit, and delete comments on various content, real-time search suggestions to enhance the user experience, and comprehensive playlist management. The design is responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

The project is organized into directories for assets, components, contexts, hooks, pages, services, and utilities. Key components include `Login.jsx` and `Signup.jsx` for authentication, `CommentList.jsx` and `CommentForm.jsx` for managing comments, `SearchBar.jsx` for search functionality, and `PlaylistList.jsx` and `PlaylistForm.jsx` for playlist management.
